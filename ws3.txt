The Problem Of Information is particularly recommended for inclusion with Library Science and Information Science reference collections because of its expertly detailed presentation of critical meta-issues concerning texts and references of all subjects.	2003-09-18

The crew was under supplied as Stefansson expected them to live off the frozen tundra.  They lacked any substantial sub zero weather experience though two once traveled beyond the Circle.  At least the men (Crawford, Knight, Maurer, and Galle) saw this expedition as a youthful lark.  The mission failed miserably and three of the team headed to Siberia, leaving Ada to tend to the dying fifth companion.  Two years later, Ada is the only one to return home; nothing but rumors of white male sightings beyond the Arctic Circle was ever heard from the trio.<br />ADA BLACKJACK is a great biography of a heroine who risks all so that her ailing son can receive proper medical care back in Nome.  The book rips the dynamic leader Stefannson who remained behind in relative comfort though that might be an unfair historiography slight.  His behavior is comparable to the World War I generals living in luxury in London, Paris, and Berlin while the grunts lacked shoes and breathed poison gas or presidents on campaign fundraisers while troops at war receive one MRE.  Ada is a great individual whose survival is so spectacular one would think her tale is fiction.  The media frenzy that follows her return brings readers back to reality as the frozen island seems warmer than the press corps.  With this superb tome and the delightful ICE MASTER, Jennifer Niven is a leader of chronicling exciting and inspiring but doomed real life Arctic expeditions.<br />Harriet Klausner	2003-11-14

This popular book and series have undoubtedly played a role in developing the importance of vision in our society in the 50 years since these stories were first written.<br /><br />The book is also prescient in another way. The current best thinking about problem solving is that scenario-based exercises are the best way to prepare to influence the future. Sure enough, that is what Asimov was talking about with Seldon's forecasting techniques.<br /><br />If that was all that Asimov accomplished, this would be one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time. But he did even more. He conceptualized the significance of finding offsets to the kind of bureaucratic stalls that can delay progress. While Joseph Heller was inventing Catch 22 to identify the problem, Asimov was already onto the cure. Asimov's solution: a secret second foundation that works behind the scenes without bureaucracy to do the real work of making a difference. In my own research on how change happens in organizations, it is always the stealth activities that work best.<br /><br />In a sense, any view of history would lead to the same conclusion -- that progress and regression will usually succeed one another in that order. That was the point of Toynbee's work on history. Asimov has made that point very elegantly here.<br /><br />What I love about this book are the many brilliant philosophical perspectives woven into the story. I wish my philosophy classes had been this interesting!<br /><br />The drawback of the book is that Asimov is not one to overly polish his writing. So it works, but lacks the beauty we normally associate with great books. Don't let that hold you back.<br /><br />These ideas and concepts for dealing with them are among the most irresitible ever conceived of for thinking about our futures. As you read and enjoy this wonderful novel, be sure to consider what its lessons are for existing organizations, like the one your work for, the schools your children or grandchildren attend, the government, and volunteer organizations like the Red Cross. You'll be amazed how much more you will get from this book if you do. For this is really a management book, as well as a science fiction book.<br /><br />This book has constantly inspired me.

It is very refreshing to see written many things I have thought about: romance, politics and the Hip-Hop community. Ms. Jamal and her collection of \\"in yo face\\" words make you stand up and take notice.<br />Ms. Jamal touches on your fears, accomplishments and fantasies. On page 10, she introduces Ghetto Poem, my interpretation of this poem is about how close we all are to being homeless. Looking at someone else's backyard could easily be my own one day. As scary as some of Jamal's work is, it is our reality, and the world we live in. I challenge you to take the plunge and delve into Passion, Pride, and Politickin. It's a wonderful experience.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-09-17

Each of these twelve base foods are used as the base ingredients for some 200 recipes. First, I opened the book to the recipes using -- what else -- chocolate. There are twenty or so chocolate recipes.  <br /> <br />Then I found the salsa recipes. Black Bean and Mango Salsa is the only one I've made so far, it rapidly disappeared at a party last weekend. A couple of other dips and salsas are on my to do list.  <br /> <br />I didn't realize that so much good could be made with healthy stuff. The only thing I need to check is if I can use pecans rather than walnuts. Let me re-word this I'm going to use pecans, I wonder if they are as healthy.	2005-06-17

Try a dinosaur	I noticed that there are editions of \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" in Spanish and French, which is not surprising because the art of Mark Teague certainly translates into any language.  Author Jane Yolen poses the questions regarding what happens when Papa or Mama comes to turn off the lights and send their dinosaurs to bed, and Teague comes up with the utterly charming images that will delight readers of any age.  Part of the fun is that Papa and Mama are regular human beings, so when Papa shows up and points to his watch to a Tyrannosaurus Rex that takes up an entire page as a way of suggesting it is time to put away his toy train and go to bed, you just have to smile (note the family dog is about the size of one of the T Rex's toes).  From the Stegosaurus that slams his tail and pouts to the Ankylosaurus that demands a piggyback ride, each of these two-page spreads will make parents happy that they just have regular human kids and not dinosaurs.<br />For children the fun will be in answering the question of the title and discovering that dinosaurs and little kids have a lot in common when it comes to resisting being put into bed.  There is a slight risk that your kids might find a new way of prolonging the inevitable and find themselves imitation the Corythosaurus and falling on top of their covers and crying or stomping their feet on the floor and shouting they want to have another book read to them.  But then \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" really covers all of the basic delaying tactics of children.  Besides, it is clearly indicated that these tactics are a bit silly, even if you are a sulking Allosaurus or roaring Triceratops.<br />All of the illustrations in this book are a joy, including those inside the front cover where Teague shows all of these dinosaurs sitting atop their beds doing things like blowing bubbles or quietly reading a good book (okay, the Ankylosaurus is jumping on the bed, but clearly he is the high energy one of the group).  \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" is the first in a series of similar collaborations between Yolen and Teague that includes \\"How Do Dinosaurs Count to Ten?\\" \\"How Do Dinosaurs Get Well Soon?\\" and \\"How Do Dinosaurs Clean Their Room?\\" That last one is definitely the one I want to check out next, because I shudder to think what Yolen and Teague will come up for in those situations.  You think getting a Dinosaur to say goodnight is difficult?  That is nothing compared to getting them to clean their rooms.Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" is the first in a series of similar collaborations between Yolen and Teague that includes \\"How Do Dinosaurs Count to Ten?\\" \\"How Do Dinosaurs Get Well Soon?\\" and \\"How Do Dinosaurs Clean Their Room?\\" That last one is definitely the one I want to check out next, because I shudder to think what Yolen and Teague will come up for in those situations.

It gives rules for the wife on how to keep her husband happy. Now there are those who say it is not the wife's business to keep her husband happy. Why should he be happy after all? But for those women who do care about pleasing their husbands it seems to me some of these rules might help. Most of them are really ' common sense' . Among them are\\"  Relax During the Engagement and Wedding,Continue to be a Creature Unlike any other, Keep up your Looks- But don't go Crazy- Keep up your own Interests- Lower your expectations in the first year( I suspect this is a big one) Be A team, Give him fifteen minutes alone when he comes home, Be supportive, Accept some things are none of your business, Try not to call him too much at work, Rarely return his gifts, Don't expect a lot of sympathy from your husband,  Say what you mean , but don't say it Meanly. There are about twenty more such rules all I think to keep together a marriage which just does not sound that great.<br /><br />I wonder if the authors'husbands think of writing a parallel work about how to please their wives.<br /><br />In this regard I will go one rule. 'Discover the subjects about which your spouse not only cannot stand to be contradicted, but which they very much need your support and backing in regard to. And whether you consider them objectively absolutely right, back them up wholly' You are the one person in the world they most need to be for them.<br /><br />Also keep em laughing as much as it is possible.	2005-01-26

The New York Fire Department (FDNY) seemed a company of heroes in the months after September 11, 2001. Later, when investigations revealed the enormity of the blunders and the degree to which petty political infighting had literally doomed firefighters to death, the FDNY lost a bit of its luster. But FDNY traditionally has a core of strong leaders, and John Salka is one of them. In this book, he shares his leadership philosophy. It's no slur to observe that this is a leadership book for firehouse buffs who are as interested in firefighter yarns as in leadership. The leadership principles outlined here are sound but not new; what is fresh is that the author illustrates those principles with fire fighting stories, clearly far more interesting than war stories from accounting - even if a bit remote from most people's everyday business reality. After all, few business people risk their lives in their daily work, and probably no business has the esprit de corps of a firehouse. We recommend this book to business people across the professions. The ride inside the fire truck will keep you engrossed in its solid leadership lessons.	2004-08-30

Newell Williams was a professor of church history at my seminary prior to heading off to Brite Divinity School to assume the leadership there.  That academic administrators are failed scholars is not a charge that could be leveled against Williams, and this book is primary evidence to that.  Williams is a scholar of insight and precision, developing his subject thoroughly, carefully, and with great clarity.<br />Barton Stone is a figure of great importance in the history of Christianity in America (a subject of great importance in the history of America, one that tends to get lost in the early education of many students in the public school systems who still shy away from incorporating anything that smacks of religiosity for fear of violating the church/state split).  It is remarkable that volumes on Stone are few and far between.  The influence of the early Presbyterians and the off-shoots on the overall religious ethos of America can be seen across many denominations never directly in communion or administrative relationship with them.<br />Stone and his ministerial colleagues looked to a great revival, something that often inspires dread in established denominational hierarchies.  Dissolving formal alliances with the Presbyterians and avoiding any descriptive terms save `Christian', Stone's path eventually led to a community with the followers of Alexander Campbell, becoming by the time of the Civil War the fifth largest Christian group in America.  Inspired both by the greater spirit of liberty developing out of the aftermath of a successful war for independence and the expansion into new territories in the West, and the experience at Cane Ridge, America's Pentecost.  Stone rejected the doctrine of predestination (which in many ways violated the sense of freedom so present in the young American republic), and yet Williams' main thesis is that there was no influence greater in Stone's development than his Presbyterian spirituality.<br />The development of the book follows the general pattern of Barton Stone's life.  In the first part, Williams explores the family and social background of Stone, as well as his training and call to be a minister.  Williams points out that Stone was not an untrained minister (as has been reported by other historians), but rather had significant training and education that included the standard ministerial training in biblical languages and topics.  Williams gives an interesting account of Stone's pre-ordination struggles with reconciling himself to the doctrines of the Confession of Faith, including his search through scriptures and reason for consistency, and Stone's eventual qualified response when asked at his ordination if he could receive and adopt the Confession of Faith: `I do, as far as I see it consistent with the word of God.'<br />The second part gives attention to the Great Revival in considerable detail.  Stone's experience led to conflicts and eventual separation, but this was not without great struggle and conversation.  Stone's respect for many who were opposing him (David Rice, whose arguments that any departure from a fairly strict Calvinism would eventually lead to atheism which did not ultimately persuade Stone, is one such example) is apparent in Stone's own writing.  Williams' explanation of the proceedings gives good insight into the way church organisations worked (and, in many ways, continue to work) in American society.<br />The three final sections all deal with the growth of the Christian church, first into an informal formality, then in union with the Campbellite Disciples as well as other groups such as the Separate Baptists, and finally as a group at action in the world for social progress.  Part of the discussion for union took place in a way reminiscent of modern wrangling between nations without formal diplomatic relations - articles in periodicals, often penned by people other than the major players, made statements and set tone for the process of union.The formal denominational structure of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) did not take place until much later in the 1960s - until then, they remained a movement; before and after there remains a part of the spirit that wishes to `sink into union with the Body of Christ at large'.<br />Williams' writing is clear, engaging, interesting and informative.  This is a good text for students of religious history, for seminarians of any denominational stamp, and for general readers who wish for insights into early American personalities.ion.

She sat at on the side of her mentor Alex, the defendant, while Shane took his place with the prosecution. A bare nod was all she got after weeks of intimate talks, long walks, and hours of fantasy. Lisa was disillusioned to realize that Shane had spent all those hours with her that spring because he wanted information that would convict Alex. The needs of his profession had been the beginning and the ending of their relationship. Indeed, Lisa had believed in two men then. One disappointed her hopes. The other broke her heart. With the trial over, she left New York to return to Wyoming, where she built a life of logic, schedules and control. <br />After all these years on the force, only one outstanding case still haunts Shane. Before he accepts his newest job offer, Shane intends to locate the missing necklace Alex absconded with. Certainly, Shane had gotten a conviction, but even after eight years he wants to know where the necklace went. At least that's his justification when he walks back into Lisa's life. His entrance into her life results in unexpectedly confronting a cold woman that distances herself from everyone rather than the joyful, spirited, artistic Lisa of his memory. Her life is so busy with work and school that Lisa doesn't have time for people. Shane intuitively knows, however, that somewhere behind those carefully constructed walls still exists the woman who identified with the Bur-Marigold, because &quot;they got around, and brighten up everywhere they went.&quot; He intends to bring that woman back.<br />Once again Patricia McLinn pens a touching romance in MY HEART REMEMBERS. The third installment of the Wyoming Wildflowers miniseries, the tie between heroine and flower seems quite appropriate. Hardly survivors who only need the slightest nurturing, both marigolds and this heroine grow despite less than ideal conditions. But with a little nurturing and sunlight, they blossom into remarkable beauties. Lisa's tentative blossoming echoes Shane's growth as well, as he moves beyond reticence into self-honesty regarding his motivations and emotions. A compelling, poignant read, MY HEART REMEMBERS comes highly recommended.	2001-12-03
